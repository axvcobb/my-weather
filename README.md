## My Weather
I found that I spend a lot of time clicking through different weather pages trying to find the data I care about. Who really cares about the pressure and dewpoint?

My solution is to create a dashboard that only has the information I care about.  The location is defaulted to my home (Atlanta), but there is an option to manually search for a city/address (using Google Geocoding), or use the browser to get your current location.

I am using https://openweathermap.org/ for the weather services and picking and choosing all I care about.
